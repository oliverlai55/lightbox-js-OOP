# Lightbox JS
Using vanilla JavaScript, Font Awesome, and Bootstrap gridding system to implement a lightbox web application.

Currently Deployed at: http://lightboxjs.surge.sh

## Purpose
I am taking this opportunity to create a front-end project using only JavaScript for interactive features.  I am also using Font Awesome for built in icons and Bootstrap 4 for its grid system.

## Future Improvements
I will refactor the codes into object oriented structure.  Also, user will have ability to add caption to the uploaded pictures.
